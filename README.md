## Overview

The PlanMyTrip app asked there Beta testers for improvement recommendations and they recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data, filter the data to their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, it will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
